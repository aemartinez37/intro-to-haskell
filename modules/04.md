# Module 4: Monads

## Week 6: Functors

### Reading

* From *Programming in Haskell*:
  - Chapter 12 (Monads and more), Functors
* From *Learn you a Haskell for great good!*:

### Exercise: Hangman

* [Hangman](/hangman/) (command-line application): Write a CLI application that
  allows you play hangman against the computer. The application should get a
  random word from a file (for example, `/usr/share/dict/words`, but feel free
  to use a different set of words) and then ask the user for a letter until all
  letters are guessed.

## Week 7: Applicative functors

### Reading

* From *Programming in Haskell*:
  - Chapter 12 (Monads and more), Applicatives
* From *Learn you a Haskell for great good!*:
  - [Chapter 11 (Functors, applicative functors, and monoids)](http://learnyouahaskell.com/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids)
  - [Chapter 12 (A fistful of monads)](http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads)
  - [Chapter 13 (For a few monads more)](http://learnyouahaskell.com/for-a-few-monads-more)

### Exam

- [Exam 2](/exams/02.md)

## Week 8

### Reading

* From *Programming in Haskell*:
  - Chapter 12 (Monads and more), Monads
  - Chapter 13 (Monadic parsing)
* From *Learn you a Haskell for great good!*:
  - [Chapter 12 (A fistful of monads)](http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads)

### Project: Haiku

* [Haiku](/haiku/) (web application): Write a Haiku generator using the
  [Wordbot](https://noopschallenge.com/challenges/wordbot) GitHub Noop. Don't
  worry about syllables, you can generate nonsense haikus that get a random
  number of words for three lines.
