# Module 1: Introduction

## Week 1: Getting started

### Reading

* From *Programming in Haskell*:
  - Chapter 1 (Introduction)
  - Chapter 2 (First steps)
* From *Learn you a Haskell for great good!*:
  - [Chapter 1 (Introduction)](http://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction)
  - [Chapter 2 (Starting out)](http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out)

### Exercise: Hello, Haskell!

* Install [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/).

### Project: Put it to the test!

> It is vital to write Haskell code for yourself as you go along, as you can't
> learn to program by just reading. Try out the examples from each chapter as
> you proceed, and solve the exercises for each chapter before checking the
> solutions.
> —Graham Hutton, *Programming in Haskell*

* Create an [experiments](/experiments/) repository.

## Week 2: Types and classes

### Reading

* From *Programming in Haskell*:
  - Chapter 3 (Types and classes)
* From *Learn you a Haskell for great good!*:
  - [Chapter 3 (Types and type classes)](http://learnyouahaskell.com/types-and-typeclasses)

### Exercise: Luhn (Optional)

* [CIS 194 (Spring 2013): Homework 1][homework/01], exercises 1–4 (Validating
  credit card numbers). You can use the [luhn](/luhn/) template to solve the
  exercises.
  - Note: Try solving the Luhn exercise, but don't worry about it if you think
    that you need a little more time to do it. We'll revisit it next week!
