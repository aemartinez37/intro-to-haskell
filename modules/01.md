# Module 1: Introduction

## Week 1: Getting started

* From *Programming in Haskell*:
  - Chapter 1 (Introduction)
  - Chapter 2 (First steps)
* From *Learn you a Haskell for great good!*:
  - [Chapter 1 (Introduction)](http://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction)
  - [Chapter 2 (Starting out)](http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out)

### Exercise: Install Haskell

- [Stack](https://haskellstack.org/)

### Exercise: Put it to the test!

<blockquote>
  <p>
    It is vital to write Haskell code for yourself as you go along, as you can't
learn to program by just reading. Try out the examples from each chapter as you
proceed, and solve the exercises for each chapter before checking the solutions.
